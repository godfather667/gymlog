Exercises with thisnotation will be stored in the database to insure historical charts are accurate.**_However, these exercises will not be displayed in the Pagefile produced for daily workouts._****USER GUIDE:**This program was a personal project to map my progress in weight training.  After 4/12 years in and out of a wheel chairdue to six knee operations, I had to rehab my body so I could return to a more normal life.The file *Initialization File (__gymlog.ini__)* contains:ged!**EXERCISE SECTION LAYOUT:**- Exercise Code- Exercise Description- Exercise 1 Specification- Exercise 2 Specification-**EXERCISE SPECIFICATION:**- "("- Cycle - How many times the reps and weights will be repeated- "x"- Reps - How many reps per weight- "@"- Weight - The weight to the nearest pound (or Kg)- ")"(4x10x70) Means  4 cycles of 10 times at 70lbs**One Note:** Some Exercises only have two entries; --- Example:  PW Pool Walk (5x200)  --- Some exercises have no weight: --- I walk  five laps of 200 yards in the shallow side of the Pool.In these cases the Reps are placed in the Weight Position in the chart.There are two Exercise Specifications.  These where primarily documenting any "Warm Ups" for a particular exercise. Only the exercise with the highest  number of reps will be used.**CHART COMMAND:**The chart lists exercises in database order.  ```Rec Date  |FWC |FWT |FWW |TRI |LP  |LAT |FLY |LC  |LE  |ROW |CP  |CR  |LR  |HT  |PW  |PC  |----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|1/5/2020  |20  |30  |20  |70  |240 |90  |20  |70  |70  |85  |35  |110 |20  |40  |200 |20  |----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|1/5/2020  |20  |30  |20  |70  |240 |90  |20  |70  |70  |85  |35  |110 |20  |40  |200 |20  |----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|1/5/2020  |20  |30  |20  |70  |240 |90  |20  |70  |70  |85  |35  |110 |20  |40  |200 |20  |----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|```Only the weights for the highest number of reps is shown!
